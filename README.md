# V4F_agrivoltaics
This GitHub repository tracks our study on vertical agrivoltaics, examining crop reactions to different distances from PV panels and the substitution of mineral fertilizer with biogas-derived digestate. We explore the interplay between crop production, renewable energy, and sustainable nutrient cycling.
